Important Logistics for Minors
Hi there, 
We’re incredibly excited we’ve been given permission to have high schoolers at AthenaHacks! We think it’s important for young women to be given the opportunity to develop an interest in tech as soon as possible.

However, there are lots of liability issues with having minors on campus overnight so USC is not allowing us to have any minors at AthenaHacks overnight.

This means that all minors will need to be picked up by their parents at 8 pm on Saturday night (all minors must be off campus by 9 pm) and can return on Sunday at 7 am. 

Additionally, at check-in, we will need you to fill out an extra waiver and give us your parent/guardian’s phone number.

We’re sorry for the inconveniences but will do whatever we can to help make this as smooth as possible!

We’ll see you soon at AthenaHacks 2017; let us know if you have questions!
